# Daniel's Portfolio Website

## Purpose

The purpose of this site is to showcase my skills and talents. I fully expect it to change regularly early while reverting to some final product as I iterate more. Feel free to comment and let me know what you think.

## Updates

> ### 5/12/2021 - First Noted Update
>
> This is not the inception of this project but this is the first written update. Initial steps have been exploring Node/Express on the backend while writing some basic JS.
> 
> I've added a semi-functional blog system that will authenticate one user (me). My password is hashed and returns a token upon succesful login. That token will be used for POST/PUT/> DELETE requests.
>
> The file system is poorly organized but manageble for this project.
